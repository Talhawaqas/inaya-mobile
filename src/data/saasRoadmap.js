// src/data/saasRoadmap.js
//
// Canonical content for the public Business SaaS Roadmap screen.
//
// MIRROR, NOT AN IMPORT: inaya-network-dapp (web) and inaya-mobile are
// separate repositories with no shared package between them, so this file
// is a deliberate, intentionally-identical copy of
// inaya-network-dapp/src/lib/saasRoadmap.js's content — same stage
// numbers, titles, statuses, descriptions, and feature lists, word for
// word. If you change one, change the other and diff them against each
// other before shipping either — this is what keeps the web and mobile
// roadmaps from ever making different claims.
//
// ACCURACY RULE (do not relax this): a stage or feature only gets marked
// LIVE here if it's actually shipped and working today. Stage 4 (AI
// Business Assistant) is real and shipped on BOTH web and mobile — this
// app's Business Workspace has an "Ask the AI Assistant" action on each
// company card (src/screens/business/BusinessAIScreen.js), calling the
// same POST /api/ai/business-chat and the same permission-scoped tools
// the web version uses. This app's separate, older "Ask AI" screen (a
// general docs assistant, /api/ai/chat) is unrelated and still exists
// alongside it. Stage 6 (Business Operations) is now fully real and
// shipped — Projects & Tasks, CRM, Procurement, and Inventory all have a
// real schema, workflow/permission enforcement, API routes, an org-wide
// activity log, dashboard summaries, AI tools, and web+mobile UI. See
// inaya-network-dapp/BUSINESS_OPERATIONS_TASKS.md, _CRM.md,
// _PROCUREMENT.md, and _INVENTORY.md for what each module covers and
// what's explicitly still out of scope. Stage 7 (Finance & HR) is now
// real and shipped too — Invoices, Expenses, Payments, CSV reporting,
// Employee records, Employee documents, Leave management, and Department
// Administration all have a real schema, workflow/permission
// enforcement, API routes, an org-wide activity log, dashboard
// summaries, AI tools, and web+mobile UI. See
// inaya-network-dapp/BUSINESS_OPERATIONS_FINANCE.md and _HR.md for what
// each module covers and what's explicitly out of scope (no PDF invoice
// generation, no payroll/tax processing, no regulated banking — a
// testnet demonstration/validation layer). Stage 8 (Business Intelligence)
// is now real and shipped too — the Inaya Business Insights & KPI
// Dashboard: KPI cards, period-over-period comparison, trend charts, and
// business alerts, computed from the same permission-scoped data every
// other module already reads, plus a dedicated AI tool
// (get_business_insights). Web + mobile (mobile has KPIs/alerts, no
// trend charts yet). See inaya-network-dapp/BUSINESS_OPERATIONS_INSIGHTS.md.
// Stage 9 (AI-Powered Business Operations) moved from FUTURE to LIVE
// 2026-09-01 — the AI can now propose real (never self-execute) changes
// across 9 domains, gated by the exact real permission the underlying
// action requires, a mandatory 36h delay, risk classification, proposal
// expiration, and a cryptographic audit trail with self-service export.
// 19 automated tests, 11 of them adversarial security scenarios. See
// inaya-network-dapp/docs/ai-controlled-actions.md for the full
// breakdown, including what's explicitly still not covered (AI-driven
// record creation, task reassignment, transaction categorization,
// communication sending).

    features: [
      "Duplicate-safe bank statement import (CSV and OFX/QFX), document ingestion with malware scan, magic-byte checks, hashing and encrypted storage, and field extraction with provenance and arithmetic validation",
      "Categorization by rule, then approved mapping, then history, then AI; payment-to-bill and receipt-to-invoice matching including part payments, over/under payments, fees, one payment covering several invoices, currency differences, and purchase-order / goods-received / bill three-way match",
      "A review queue with ten actions (approve, reject, edit, re-match, split, merge, mark duplicate, request document, defer, escalate) that learns corrections without rewriting history",
      "Anomaly signals with mandatory wording (\"Potential anomaly detected: human review required\"), configurable and audited thresholds, reports (CSV), a month-end checklist that is explicitly not a statutory close, and read-only what-if scenarios labelled SIMULATED",
      "Business Insights, AI assistant tool, a Finance Operations Manager automation template, notifications, Evidence Graph and audit chain -- all reusing existing systems, with no second ledger",

    notes:
      "This is WEB/DESKTOP ONLY -- no mobile app surface exists for this feature yet; listed here for completeness. Verified against the real database (flow, unit and security suites, including organization and department isolation, webhook signatures and replay, and hostile files). NOT verified against real outside accounts: live bank feeds (no provider is registered; import statements instead), a live email provider, a real WhatsApp Business account (tested against a stand-in for Meta), and OCR of images and scanned PDFs (no local OCR engine; depends on the AI model and is never auto-processed). Inaya has no general ledger and none was invented; no savings figures are estimated. Excel and PDF report exports are not offered.",

    title: "Whole-Codebase Quality Review & Hardening -- Independent SQA Across the Ecosystem",
    status: ROADMAP_STATUS.IN_PROGRESS,
    description:
      "An independent quality audit that deliberately tries to break Inaya rather than re-running existing tests: every API route is probed for access-control gaps, real client tools (the official AWS command line, rclone) are driven against Inaya's storage, and the money, bridge and payment flows are attacked. Each confirmed defect is reproduced, fixed and locked in with an automated regression test, and everything is recorded in a defect registry with severity, root cause and status. Phase one is delivered; the review is continuing across the remaining repositories.",
    securityStatement: "Findings are fixed without weakening permissions, changing public behavior unnecessarily or disabling tests. No 'bug-free' claim is made: the final report states what is ready, what carries evidence-backed risk and what could not be verified.",
    features: [
      "Critical bridge fix: the relayer now signs only messages the source blockchain really emitted (verified against the real contract), and public registration routes can no longer overwrite or forge transfers",
      "Card payments settle on-chain exactly once (a retried payment notification used to settle twice) and an unpaid checkout session can no longer identify a customer",
      "Storage fixes found with the real AWS command line: object names with spaces, brackets or non-ASCII characters authenticate; large uploads complete once; presigned URLs work; ranged reads pass client validation; the S3 ETag is the content MD5; writes fall back when one storage provider is blocked",
      "Access-control fixes: points, node assignment, the test faucet, the public node listing and anonymous endpoints; signatures with far-future timestamps no longer stay valid forever",
      "Two whole-product sweeps guard the result: no company can reach another company's data through any of 453 organization routes, and no other route changes anything for an anonymous visitor (225 routes); all cron routes refuse a wrong secret",
      "Test-suite health: the standard contract test run works again (175 passing), a test-runner hang that would freeze automated checks was fixed, and non-breaking dependency fixes were applied",
    ],
    notes:
      "This is WEB/DESKTOP ONLY -- no mobile app surface exists for this feature yet; listed here for completeness. In progress. Done: main dApp routes, bridge, payments, S3 layer against the AWS CLI and rclone, contract suite, dependency audit. Still to do: Azure, Google Cloud Storage and Terraform against Inaya storage with their real tools; mobile, desktop and Inaya Drive on real devices (needs hardware); concurrency and failure injection; smart-contract static analysis; performance; CI review; and a complete re-run of the 179 test files. Open risks recorded: wallet-address metadata reads are unauthenticated by design, card-customer identity is the payer's email, the main dApp is on a Next.js version whose fix needs a major upgrade, and deleting an object does not yet unpin its provider copy. Provider plan limits (Pinata blocked, Filebase at its 500-pin free limit) need the owner's action.",
