// src/data/saasRoadmap.js
//
// Canonical content for the public Business SaaS Roadmap screen.
//
// MIRROR, NOT AN IMPORT: inaya-network-dapp (web) and inaya-mobile are
// separate repositories with no shared package between them, so this file
// is a deliberate, intentionally-identical copy of
// inaya-network-dapp/src/lib/saasRoadmap.js's content — same stage
// numbers, titles, statuses, descriptions, and feature lists, word for
// word. If you change one, change the other and diff them against each
// other before shipping either — this is what keeps the web and mobile
// roadmaps from ever making different claims.
//
// ACCURACY RULE (do not relax this): a stage or feature only gets marked
// LIVE here if it's actually shipped and working today. Stage 4 (AI
// Business Assistant) is real and shipped on BOTH web and mobile — this
// app's Business Workspace has an "Ask the AI Assistant" action on each
// company card (src/screens/business/BusinessAIScreen.js), calling the
// same POST /api/ai/business-chat and the same permission-scoped tools
// the web version uses. This app's separate, older "Ask AI" screen (a
// general docs assistant, /api/ai/chat) is unrelated and still exists
// alongside it. Stage 6 (Business Operations) is now fully real and
// shipped — Projects & Tasks, CRM, Procurement, and Inventory all have a
// real schema, workflow/permission enforcement, API routes, an org-wide
// activity log, dashboard summaries, AI tools, and web+mobile UI. See
// inaya-network-dapp/BUSINESS_OPERATIONS_TASKS.md, _CRM.md,
// _PROCUREMENT.md, and _INVENTORY.md for what each module covers and
// what's explicitly still out of scope. Stage 7 (Finance & HR) is now
// real and shipped too — Invoices, Expenses, Payments, CSV reporting,
// Employee records, Employee documents, Leave management, and Department
// Administration all have a real schema, workflow/permission
// enforcement, API routes, an org-wide activity log, dashboard
// summaries, AI tools, and web+mobile UI. See
// inaya-network-dapp/BUSINESS_OPERATIONS_FINANCE.md and _HR.md for what
// each module covers and what's explicitly out of scope (no PDF invoice
// generation, no payroll/tax processing, no regulated banking — a
// testnet demonstration/validation layer). Stage 8 has no implementation
// anywhere — roadmap direction only.
