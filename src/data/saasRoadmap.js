// src/data/saasRoadmap.js
//
// Canonical content for the public Business SaaS Roadmap screen.
//
// MIRROR, NOT AN IMPORT: inaya-network-dapp (web) and inaya-mobile are
// separate repositories with no shared package between them, so this file
// is a deliberate, intentionally-identical copy of
// inaya-network-dapp/src/lib/saasRoadmap.js's content — same stage
// numbers, titles, statuses, descriptions, and feature lists, word for
// word. If you change one, change the other and diff them against each
// other before shipping either — this is what keeps the web and mobile
// roadmaps from ever making different claims.
//
// ACCURACY RULE (do not relax this): a stage or feature only gets marked
// LIVE here if it's actually shipped and working today. Stage 4 (AI
// Business Assistant) is real and shipped on BOTH web and mobile — this
// app's Business Workspace has an "Ask the AI Assistant" action on each
// company card (src/screens/business/BusinessAIScreen.js), calling the
// same POST /api/ai/business-chat and the same permission-scoped tools
// the web version uses. This app's separate, older "Ask AI" screen (a
// general docs assistant, /api/ai/chat) is unrelated and still exists
// alongside it. Stage 6 (Business Operations) is now fully real and
// shipped — Projects & Tasks, CRM, Procurement, and Inventory all have a
// real schema, workflow/permission enforcement, API routes, an org-wide
// activity log, dashboard summaries, AI tools, and web+mobile UI. See
// inaya-network-dapp/BUSINESS_OPERATIONS_TASKS.md, _CRM.md,
// _PROCUREMENT.md, and _INVENTORY.md for what each module covers and
// what's explicitly still out of scope. Stage 7 (Finance & HR) is now
// real and shipped too — Invoices, Expenses, Payments, CSV reporting,
// Employee records, Employee documents, Leave management, and Department
// Administration all have a real schema, workflow/permission
// enforcement, API routes, an org-wide activity log, dashboard
// summaries, AI tools, and web+mobile UI. See
// inaya-network-dapp/BUSINESS_OPERATIONS_FINANCE.md and _HR.md for what
// each module covers and what's explicitly out of scope (no PDF invoice
// generation, no payroll/tax processing, no regulated banking — a
// testnet demonstration/validation layer). Stage 8 (Business Intelligence)
// is now real and shipped too — the Inaya Business Insights & KPI
// Dashboard: KPI cards, period-over-period comparison, trend charts, and
// business alerts, computed from the same permission-scoped data every
// other module already reads, plus a dedicated AI tool
// (get_business_insights). Web + mobile (mobile has KPIs/alerts, no
// trend charts yet). See inaya-network-dapp/BUSINESS_OPERATIONS_INSIGHTS.md.
// Stage 9 (AI-Powered Business Operations) moved from FUTURE to LIVE
// 2026-09-01 — the AI can now propose real (never self-execute) changes
// across 9 domains, gated by the exact real permission the underlying
// action requires, a mandatory 36h delay, risk classification, proposal
// expiration, and a cryptographic audit trail with self-service export.
// 19 automated tests, 11 of them adversarial security scenarios. See
// inaya-network-dapp/docs/ai-controlled-actions.md for the full
// breakdown, including what's explicitly still not covered (AI-driven
// record creation, task reassignment, transaction categorization,
// communication sending).

    notes:
      "This is WEB/DESKTOP ONLY -- no mobile app surface exists for the Evidence Graph or Digital Twin yet; listed here for completeness. Live-verified: 47 tests for the Evidence Graph layer and 9 tests for the Digital Twin layer, all passing against the real database, with zero regressions to any pre-existing test suite. The single strongest test in both layers is the same: run every simulation/scenario type, snapshot every record it reads before and after, and assert byte-for-byte equality -- proving a simulation can never silently become a real action. Cross-organization Digital Twins were researched (zero-knowledge proofs, secure multiparty computation, trusted execution) and deliberately deferred rather than built, since no validated customer need for it exists yet. Not yet built: a graph-visualization UI, versioned Twin snapshots, and natural-language scenario creation.",
